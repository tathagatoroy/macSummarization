      "Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife.",
      "Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman.",
      "You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place.",
      "Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay.",
      "\"Previously I'd been involved with costume making...",
      "I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says.",
      "But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article.",
      "\"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains.",
      "\"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\"",
      "In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\"",
      "The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical.",
      "Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap.",
      "Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign.",
      "He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days.",
      "\"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs.",
      "Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\"",
      "Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\"",
      "Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows.",
      "After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins.",
      "Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\"",
      "The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop.",
      "Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\"",
      "Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl.",
      "Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy.",
      "Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval.",
      "The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty.",
      "\"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says.",
      "That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance.",
      "He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "The jackets have received particular attention.",
      "Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community.",
      "\"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\"",
      "Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol.",
      "Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits.",
      "For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero."

      "Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar.",
      "The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said.",

On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that the bureau chief had been seized. Rezaian was charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments, and collecting information with malicious intent. There has been a tendency of rogue regimes to seize hostages during the diplomacy process to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease.

      "But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief.",
      "On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \"with malicious intent.\"",
      "The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage.",
      "Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease.",
      "The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past.",
      "But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern.",
      "Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days.",
      "Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious.",
      "The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan.",
      "According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted.",
      "Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world.",
      "Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was \"betraying\" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement.",
      "Khomeini endorsed their action.",
      "\"Our young people must foil these plots,\" he reportedly said.",
      "The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands.",
      "Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare.",
      "Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode.",
      "Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon.",
      "Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages.",
      "Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum.",
      "Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans.",
      "Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions.",
      "Of course, Iran is not alone in such games.",
      "Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises.",

      "North Korea's police force put out word that \"General Kim Jong Un's artifice let former U.S. President Clinton cross the Pacific to apologize to the Great Leader.",
      "It was all made possible thanks to General Kim Jong Un's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics.\"",
      "North Korea's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance.",
      "Ling and Lee were neither the first nor the last Americans that North Korea seized during the Obama era.",
      "After North Korea torpedoed a South Korean ship, killing 46, Obama sought North Korea's censure in the U.N. Security Council.",
      "Pyongyang responded by threatening Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering North Korea.",
      "On cue, former President Jimmy Carter arrived to mediate for Gomes' release, called for new talks and, by omission, derailed efforts to hold North Korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen South Korean sailors.",
      "The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions.",
      "The following year, North Korea arrested an 85-year-old Korean War veteran touring the hermit kingdom and, the next year, took two other tourists hostage.",
      "Each arrest resulted in a high-level visit, an apology to North Korea that bolstered the dear leader's claims of strength and renewed engagement.",
      "Saddam Hussein likewise worked from the same playbook.",
      "In March 1995, Iraqi security forces seized two American defense contractors who strayed into Iraq from Kuwait.",

      "The American media lauded Richardson, but his trip was not without cost: Saddam used it to depict Iraq as strong and America as weak.",
      "\"President Saddam Hussein ... accepts the pleas by Bill Clinton, the Congress and American people,\" the Iraqi News Agency reported.",
      "And so did the Taliban.",
      "Fifteen years before Obama traded alleged American deserter Bowe Bergdahl for five high-value Taliban and alleged al Qaeda operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the Taliban arrested two Americans female missionaries.",
      "Their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of Clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the Taliban; the Taliban, too, knew how holding Americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions.",
      "So what does Iran's hostage brinkmanship portend?",
      "Diplomats drink their own Kool-Aid, and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold.",
      "Ego, ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries.",
      "Hostages such as Rezaian are canaries in the coal mine, however.",
      "Their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy."

Other speculations over the cause of the fire stated that the controversy between the police and young African-Americans could have also been a probable cause of the riot. A high unemployment rate among the youths in Baltimore has naturally led to civil unrest and destruction of property because of idleness and desperation. Consequently, other social issues that come into play including dropping out of school and neglected projects also give rise to the occurrence of riots and destruction.",

      "Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history.",
      "During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive.",
      "And this \"Abenesia\" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda.",
      "Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response.",
      "Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds.",
      "Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds.",
      "President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined.",
      "But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese.",
      "As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed.",
      "It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential.",
      "Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history.",
      "He did express \"eternal condolences\" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, \"Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit.\"",
      "That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past.",
      "Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education.",
      "He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship.",
      "Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century.",
      "But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder.",
      "What Abe said is, \"Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war.",
      "Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries.",
      "We must not avert our eyes from that.",
      "I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard.\"",
      "Essentially outsourcing \"apology and war responsibility\" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale.",
      "It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa.",
      "Rather than merely \"upholding\" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology.",
      "In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility.",
      "Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so.",
      "Murayama clearly condemned \"mistaken national policy,\" \"self-righteous nationalism,\" \"colonial rule\" and \"aggression,\" but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called \"masochistic\" view of Japan's wartime history.",
      "Fatalistically, Abe said, \"History is harsh.",
      "What is done cannot be undone.\"",
      "Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia.",
      "Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan.",
      "Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards.",
      "What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: \"Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most.",
      "In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.\"",
      "This cavalier \"sh*t happens\" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward.",
      "In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment.",
      "Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised.",
      "In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence.",
      "To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns.",
      "Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day.",
      "Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell.",
      "In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom.",
      "This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs.",
      "Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe.",
      "The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along.",
      "In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics.",
      "Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier.",
      "Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \"alliance of hope.\"",
      "That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear.",
      "Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land.",
      "In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation.",
      "In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project.",
      "Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.",

Bench warrants for failing to appear in court to settle child support is about bill collection, and sometimes the only way to get the parent to pay is for them to get sent to jail for the weekend or so. If families can't settle their disputes for noncustodial support privately, it's up to the courts to uphold the order, and law enforcement gets involved to do so. Arresting deadbeat parents is acknowledged to be extreme, and perhaps it could be solved with more involvement from the community instead to have a better ending, but there is no other way approved to get the parents to pay for the child support.",

      "(CNN)It won't come as news to anyone in America today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force.",
      "But the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority (initial stop and question, pulling someone over for a traffic violation) becomes significant because of the potential result (deadly force).",
      "A minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants.",
      "An initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest.",
      "And an arrest, we know, can have fatal results.",
      "In South Carolina earlier this month, Walter Scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $18,000 in unpaid child support, according to court records.",
      "That means that once he was stopped, he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion.",
      "But failure to pay child support is not a crime.",
      "At least, not in the traditional sense, though states do criminalize it.",
      "It's rightly a civil matter.",
      "Skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either.",
      "This means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court isn't about catching criminals -- it's bill collection, only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons, and acting under color of law.",
      "This raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing.",
      "Not all \"warrants\" are created equal.",
      "Sometimes there are warrants for arrest, which are issued for alleged murders, drug dealing or sexual assault.",
      "Then there are cases like the Scott case.",
      "Bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes.",
      "Don't get me wrong.",
      "Deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well-being today.",
      "Forget the school-to-prison-pipeline.",
      "Lousy parents are the prison pipeline; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads.",
      "Still, given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws, there is ultimately something Dickensian in our remedy for enforcement.",
      "First, it's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event.",
      "Yes, parents who can't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts, but once the courts and law enforcement are involved, they do things their way.",
      "And it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own.",
      "South Carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings.",
      "Oftentimes and sadly so, papa is a rolling stone, and he falls behind on his payments.",
      "When a supporting parent has fallen behind, the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order.",
      "At the hearing, that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that, well, he would love to pay, but right now he's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established language of support shirkers.",
      "The bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he's too poor to pay his child's support.",
      "If he fails to demonstrate this inability, the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him, unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments.",
      "What follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon, a game show and debtor's prison.",
      "The defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail.",
      "If he can't, he'll be stuck in jail until he does pay.",
      "And let's face it: While it's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads, jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to, you guessed it, earn money to pay that debt.",
      "Of course, since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant, dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates \"mixed up.\"",
      "The court's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court.",
      "That warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant, but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a Friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on Monday.",
      "The point is this: Some warrants are for the arrest of criminals.",
      "Those are the warrants we're familiar with, from \"Law & Order\" and every other cop show.",
      "Other warrants, like those for contempt of a support order, have nothing to do with crime.",
      "They're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature.",
      "Yet we've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency.",
      "That's right, the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts.",
      "When they run a driver's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up, those same police who are armed with Tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills.",
      "Not because he's dangerous.",
      "Not because he's a criminal.",
      "Because he's (breathtakingly) financially irresponsible.",
      "Walter Scott might have run because he knew the drill.",
      "He knew he was going to be arrested.",
      "He shouldn't have run.",
      "But he also definitely shouldn't have been shot.",
      "If he owed $18,000 in arrears, he definitely shouldn't have been looking to buy a Mercedes, as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do.",
      "But whether or not he ran, the result would have been the same: If he had a bench warrant, he was going to jail, by force if necessary, even though he does not appear to have committed a \"crime.\"",
      "Of course, the counterargument is: If we don't arrest them, how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up?",
      "There's no easy answer.",
      "But the better question may be: Why do we as a society not shun parents who don't take care of their kids?",
      "Social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest.",
      "Arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution, and one that could be solved with less government intrusion, and more community involvement.",
      "The Scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths.",
      "If we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads, we can't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them.",
      "While no one should be shot for failure to pay support, we're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest.",
      "Are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force, empowered to use deadly force, to aid in collecting these bills?",
      "If we are, then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight.",
      "And if we're comfortable with that, then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase,and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment.",
      "Then, our only defense is to watch.",
      "And record.",
      "Note: An earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime."

      "(CNN)Last week, California Gov.",
      "Jerry Brown ordered mandatory statewide restrictions on water use for the first time in the state's history.",
      "His action was driven by a specific crisis unique to California at the moment -- the severe drought now in its fourth year there -- but it has significance for the whole nation.",
      "As it has in the past, California is leading the way in recognizing that population and economic growth has to respect the physical limits imposed by planet Earth.",
      "California developed the infrastructure and system of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet phase, historically speaking.",
      "This led to a system that all but encourages heavy water use in dry parts of the state, with little consistency in allocation or pricing and little disincentive to waste.",
      "This has never made a lot of sense, but the new measures are the strongest acknowledgment yet that it just isn't tenable today in a serious drought.",
      "As for the drought: It won't be the last, and surely won't be the worst to come in the remainder of this century.",
      "Brown's measures may be temporary, but we can hope that they'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state's water distribution system -- one that includes large agricultural users, who are not included in the current measures, although they are the dominant consumers of California's water.",
      "How the drought affects rest of the nation .",
      "What California does now has global significance: Lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in much of the world.",
      "On the Indian subcontinent, where supply can't meet the demands of rapid development, groundwater is being depleted much as it is in California, and is an equally unsustainable practice in both places.",
      "And my colleagues at Columbia recently published a study arguing that drought in Syria was one of the causes of the ongoing war there.",
      "They also presented strong evidence that the Syrian drought was in part attributable to human-induced climate change -- in itself, another physical constraint the planet places on growth.",
      "Our energy systems, like our water systems, are not sustainable.",
      "Is the California drought a consequence of climate change?",
      "A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report for which my colleague Richard Seager was lead author, argued that it isn't (though the authors acknowledge that global warming makes the drought worse by increasing evaporation from the soil).",
      "California, and southwestern North America, indeed saw worse \"megadroughts\" in the pre-Columbian past, long before any humans burned fossil fuels.",
      "At the same time, the latest projections are that the odds of such megadroughts are increasing with warming.",
      "So we're left with a complex picture, one typical of many extreme weather events.",
      "We know that human-induced climate change is increasing the risk that an event such as this will happen, while at the same time we can't strongly blame climate change for the specific event happening right now.",
      "Does it matter whether the drought is climate-change-induced or not?",
      "From a pragmatic public relations perspective, maybe.",
      "Extreme weather events make people aware that we are all vulnerable to them, and media coverage can draw attention to the scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the risks.",
      "At least in principle, this awareness can help to build the constituency for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "I lived in Australia for a year in 2007-08 when the country was well into a drought that lasted about a dozen years -- and that led to water restrictions in nearly all the country's major cities.",
      "Though the role of greenhouse gases in that drought wasn't clear either, the hardship nonetheless made Australians much more concerned about climate change than Americans were at the time.",
      "Polls showed that the issue played a significant role in the national elections held during my year there, with a climate-denialist government falling to a much more climate-proactive one (though the pendulum has since swung back).",
      "But being able to blame climate change for a specific extreme weather event shouldn't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "Whether we're talking about a drought in California, a hurricane on the East Coast, a flood in the Midwest or a tornado outbreak on the Plains, the connection of a single event to climate change is likely to be the subject of legitimate scientific controversy.",
      "The reality and seriousness of human-caused global warming, however, isn't.",
      "The scientific case that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate, and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species, doesn't rest on single-event attribution, but rather on the statistics of large sets of weather events.",
      "That big picture is what should motivate us.",
      "And when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable, in many cases it matters even less to what extent a given weather event was human-induced vs. natural.",
      "California could have had this drought, and worse, without global warming.",
      "Similarly, sea level rise is increasing the risk of coastal floods, but cities such as New Orleans, New York and many others were (and are) too vulnerable already.",
      "Because really extreme events are by definition rare, most places haven't seen the worst nature can deliver, even without climate change, in their recent histories.",
      "So our development planning has tended to proceed under the assumption that that worst won't happen, leaving us with infrastructures that aren't properly adapted even to the current climate.",
      "Many of the measures we need to take to close that gap -- such as making California's water distribution system less wasteful, or New York's subways more flood-proof -- will also help to prepare us for the new climates to come.",
      "They may not be enough, in the long term, but they're a start.",
      "We call these \"no-regrets\" measures, because they are good ideas regardless of how rapidly or slowly global warming proceeds.",
      "If California can teach the rest of us something about how to design and implement such measures for water, it will be an upside to what otherwise is nothing but a slow-moving disaster."

      "Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others.",
      "\"I'm getting ready to do something, too.",
      "I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video.",
      "\"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\"",
      "Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present.",
      "She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president.",
      "The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history.",
      "Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics.",
      "There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women.",
      "Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist.",
      "\"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office.",
      "There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University.",
      "\"People are ready for a woman president.",
      "The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\"",
      "According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime.",
      "But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines.",
      "Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do.",
      "INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again .",
      "In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer.",
      "She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough.",
      "She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events.",
      "She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\"",
      "Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on.",
      "The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history.",
      "But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics.",
      "\"She is the gender card.",
      "She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it.",
      "She is the woman candidate.",
      "She has shared women's experiences.",

      "Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said.",
      "\"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\"",
      "In 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits.",
      "Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues.",
      "And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans.",
      "Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\"",
      "\"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters.",
      "\"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign.",
      "You aren't going to win 100% of women.\"",
      "Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men.",
      "Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness.",
      "\"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said.",
      "And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent.",
      "Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell.",
      "But Clinton will have some high-profile champions.",
      "Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right.",
      "\"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement.",
      "\"I'm ready for Hillary.",
      "And America is ready for Hillary.",
      "She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\"",
      "At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\"",
      "In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes.",
      "But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches.",
      "After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated."

      "(CNN)The presence of a harmful pesticide at a luxury villa in the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in the illness of a Delaware family, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.",
      "Paramedics were called last week to a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John after the family of four fell ill.",
      "They had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22, and were later hospitalized.",
      "The illness was reported to the EPA on March 20.",
      "\"Our preliminary results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying,\" said Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman.",
      "Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA.",
      "The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity.",
      "It's not allowed to be used indoors.",
      "Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings.",
      "\"It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "\"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\"",
      "Final test results were expected next week.",
      "The EPA is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated.",
      "\"Pesticides can be very toxic, and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by EPA,\" said Judith A. Enck, a regional administrator for the EPA.",
      "\"The EPA is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere.\"",
      "Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night.",
      "Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said that the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that their unit was not treated.",
      "The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services.",
      "\"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix.",
      "In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote.",
      "James Maron, an attorney who has been a spokesman for the family, has not responded to requests for comment.",
      "The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as \"serious.\""

      "Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said.",
      "Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources.",
      "Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.",

      "So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.",
      "It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said.",
      "In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said.",

      "Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said.",
      "And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection.",
      "She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.",
      "Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself.",
      "Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day.",
      "Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence.",
      "When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal.",
      "Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.",
      "The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.",
      "Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown.",
      "There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.",
      "\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said.",

      "(CNN)Supported by American intelligence and supplied with advanced U.S.-made weaponry, Saudi jets began airstrikes in Yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom's Washington ambassador described as \"restoring the legitimate government\" and protecting a \"Yemeni constitution and elections.\"",
      "The need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy.",
      "Indeed, Saudi motives in Yemen likely have nothing to do with protecting the country's \"legitimate government,\" its constitution or its electoral process.",
      "So what is really going on?",
      "The kingdom's real motives seem clear if one looks at Saudi monarchy's history of not allowing regional competition of any kind, while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people.",
      "This approach was evident in 2013, when Saudi Arabia voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt, which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary Saudi policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the Arab Spring.",
      "The Saudi goal is simple: Prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self-determination.",
      "And the excuse of \"resisting Iran's influence,\" meanwhile, appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster.",
      "For example, in 2009, the Houthis (more accurately described as the Ansarullah) were not yet receiving help from Iran, yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes, following Saudi claims of a Houthi incursion.",
      "True, the Ansarullah movement now benefits from Iranian support.",
      "But it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region.",
      "With all this in mind, the American decision to stand behind the Saudi attack on Yemen can best be described as misguided.",
      "Although the Houthi movement's rhetoric is unquestionably anti-American, it has not targeted any American interests.",
      "In fact, when the U.S. Embassy packed up in Sanaa in January, leaving a fleet of over 20 armored SUVs behind at the airport, the Houthis reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a U.N. representative in Yemen.",
      "And while the Houthis did not welcome the American presence in Yemen, they did not interfere with U.S. operations against al Qaeda in the country.",
      "But one of the biggest miscalculations has been that U.S. policy has adopted the Saudi-Gulf narrative on Yemen, effectively placing Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like destroying the safe haven for al Qaeda there.",
      "Indeed, the Obama administration appears to have abandoned Yemen to Saudi machinations.",
      "This reality was underscored when U.S State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki effectively endorsed Saudi bombing, saying the \"Saudis have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in Yemen on their security.\"",
      "The implication here seems to be that any country \"concerned\" about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them, a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent.",
      "Back in September, White House spokesman Josh Earnest described Yemen as a success story in the war on terrorism, explaining that the U.S. priority in Yemen was not to establish a \"Jeffersonian democracy\" but to prevent Yemen from becoming a safe-haven for al Qaeda and affiliates.",
      "Yet if that policy goal remains in place, then it must be acknowledged that the Saudi war on Yemen will not only undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen a safe haven, but also undermine broader U.S. efforts in Yemen.",
      "The reality is that Saudi and Gulf Co-operation Council jets are effectively acting as al Qaeda's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al Qaeda from several Yemeni regions.",
      "Interestingly, while Saudi Arabia deployed about 100 aircraft against the Houthis on the second day of its offensive, it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early U.S.-led campaign against ISIS last year.",
      "Regardless, the results of the Saudi campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller Houthi force than today was able to outfox the Saudi military back in 2009.",
      "Back then, Houthi forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters, but they shocked the Saudi army, reportedly capturing Saudi equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 Saudi villages as it seized territory along the border.",
      "Today, that ragtag group of Houthi rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called Ansarullah, modeled after Lebanon's Hezbollah.",
      "Back in 2009, the rebels were limited to parts of the Saada region and were self-funded, although Yemen claimed they had minor assistance from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Yet despite this, they were still able to withstand some 90 days of Saudi bombardment.",
      "Today, the Ansarullah group is receiving political, financial and military support from Iran.",
      "Already, the Saudi government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports, and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions.",
      "The situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues.",
      "What should be done now?",
      "Saudi interests in Yemen should not replace those of the United States.",
      "With this in mind, the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict, one that can be embraced by the various Yemeni factions.",
      "A change in approach is essential not only because the Saudi-led war on Yemen is wrong and destined to fail, but because it might end up further opening the Yemeni door to Iran.",
      "But perhaps most importantly, by supporting a self-interested Saudi campaign, the U.S. may actually empower an al Qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the United States."

      "(CNN)A  man charged with planning the deadly 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in India has been released on bail in Pakistan after years of detention, prompting sharp criticism from India.",
      "Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was released early Friday from a jail in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, according to Yahya Mujahid, spokesman for Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a group with which Lakhvi is affiliated.",
      "Lakhvi was charged in Pakistan in 2009, accused of masterminding the November 2008 terror attacks that left more than 160 people dead in Mumbai, India's most populous city.",
      "Lakhvi still faces trial in the case.",
      "But an anti-terrorism court granted Lakhvi bail last year, a decision the Pakistani government said it would challenge.",
      "That challenge lasted until Thursday, when the Lahore High Court ordered his release, CNN affiliate and Pakistani outlet GEO News reported.",
      "Lakhvi posted bail totaling 2 million Pakistani rupees (more than $19,000), according to GEO News.",
      "India, Pakistan's neighbor and rival, condemned Lakhvi's bail release on Friday.",
      "The country contacted Pakistan's foreign secretary to underline \"that this has reinforced the perception that Pakistan has a dual policy on dealing with terrorists, and those who have carried out attacks or are posing a threat to India are being dealt with differently,\" said Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs.",
      "The accusation that Pakistan might treat India differently highlights long-running tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which have fought three wars against each other since their partition at the end of British colonial rule.",
      "Pakistan's Foreign Office responded Friday by saying, \"It would not be proper to cast aspersions on Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism at a time when Pakistan has entered a critical stage of defeating the menace of terrorism.\"",
      "The Foreign Office also blamed what it said was India's delay in cooperating in the case, saying it \"weakened the prosecution.\"",
      "In the Mumbai attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center.",

      "(CNN)A 24-year-old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance, only to have French authorities come and discover weapons, ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in Syria requested, a top prosecutor said Wednesday.",
      "The man was identified later as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told television broadcaster TF1.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said Ghlam asked for medical help at his home in Paris' 13th district Sunday morning, claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon.",
      "But authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh.",
      "Molins said Ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32-year-old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger-scale terror attack in the near future.",
      "\"(He) let them believe that he was the victim,\" French President Francois Hollande said Wednesday.",
      "\"But police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated.\"",
      "That probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect's car.",
      "Based on this discovery \"and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual,\" they looked inside the car and found a loaded Kalashnikov gun, a 9-mm revolver, three cell phones, a laptop, a USB key, a satellite navigation system \"and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets,\" Molins said.",
      "A search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence, including three more Kalashnikovs, three bulletproof vests, police armbands, a camera, some 2,000 euros in cash and \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS,\" according to the prosecutor.",
      "\"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" Hollande said.",
      "\"It's not the first time.\"",
      "Earlier Ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from Algeria.",
      "According to Molins, he lived in that North African country until 2001, joined his parents in France for the next two years, then went back to Algeria.",
      "He got his undergraduate degree in that nation, then returned to France to study electronics.",
      "He'd never been convicted of a crime; in fact, the lone accusation against him in August 2013 was later withdrawn.",
      "But that didn't mean French authorities didn't know about Ghlam.",
      "\"He had been noticed wishing to go to Syria,\" Molins explained.",
      "The prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat, \"but he was under surveillance.\"",
      "Law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year, Cazeneuve said.",
      "The minister said the man planned to head to Syria, a country embroiled in a bloody, years-long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like ISIS.",
      "There was no indication he ever made it.",
      "But, Molins said, computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in Syria who \"asked him to target a church.\"",
      "What church?",
      "Authorities didn't disclose that detail on Wednesday, though Molins did say \"this target was confirmed by (the suspect's satellite navigation system) and handwritten documents in his car.\"",
      "Paris is home to the famed Notre Dame cathedral and Sacre Coeur basilica, both huge draws for tourists.",
      "It's not known if either were in line to be attacked, but Prime Minister Manuel Valls Wednesday visited one of the churches allegedly targeted, which was located in the Paris suburb of Villejuif.",
      "Assuming Ghlam doesn't walk free anytime soon -- for now, he's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack won't happen anytime soon.",
      "But authorities say he's already claimed at least one victim.",
      "Her name is Aurelie Chatelain.",
      "The 32-year-old was found dead Sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in Villejuif, killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder, went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat.",
      "Cazeneuve said Chatelain was the mother of a 5-year-old girl and had come to the region on Saturday to attend a training class.",
      "It's not known what connection, if any, she had with the suspect.",
      "Nonetheless, Molins said that ballistics, DNA, satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of Chatelain, who Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since January.",
      "That's when the massacre at Charlie Hebdo's offices and the siege of a kosher market in Paris took place, prompting French authorities to beef up security measures.",
      "\"France, like other countries, is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude,\" Valls said.",
      "\"...",

      "Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has lifted martial law, replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta.",
      "Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's \"deepening descent into dictatorship.\"",
      "Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed.",
      "Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution \"to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability.\"",
      "Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary.",
      "According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO.",
      "Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said.",
      "Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said.",
      "Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO.",
      "Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow Prayuth \"to issue orders without administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight or accountability.\"",
      "\"Thailand's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers,\" Adams said in a statement.",
      "Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on Thailand, told CNN the move would see Prayuth \"become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes.\"",
      "\"This is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Thailand,\" he said.",
      "Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to \"reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news.",
      "\"Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,\" the High Commissioner said.",
      "\"But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all.",
      "This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights.\"",
      "Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military seized power last May, ousting the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests.",
      "Since then, the NCPO has curbed civil liberties, muzzled the media and rounded up opponents.",
      "Amnesty International says that since May, hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression.",
      "Thai political scholar and coup opponent Pavin Chachavalpongpun told CNN that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to \"pouring the same wine into a new bottle.\"",
      "\"The junta is trying to reinvent itself, but the substance is still there,\" he said.",
      "\"In a word: it's absurd.",
      "Everyone knows in Thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure.",
      "\"But Article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the NCPO.\"",
      "Thailand's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability, following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist, middle-class Bangkok elite against Shinawatra's supporters, mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north.",
      "But Pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order.",
      "\"The notion of national security has been exploited over and over,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it was important that Thai citizens were allowed \"to freely exercise their fundamental rights, including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\""

      "(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again \u2014 not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it.",
      "She sure pushed the envelope.",
      "With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run.",
      "We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work.",
      "Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing.",
      "Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\"",
      "Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\"",
      "Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes.",
      "But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think.",
      "The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\"",
      "While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple.",
      "Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008.",
      "In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers.",
      "Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand.",
      "A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.",
      "In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion.",
      "But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it.",
      "Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe.",
      "Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby.",
      "The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme.",
      "Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain.",
      "Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo.",
      "It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.",
      "In fact, her logo is all about movement.",
      "Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones.",
      "I'm here to support you with everything I've got.",
      "Let me help you move forward.",
      "Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future.",
      "Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing.",
      "For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news.",
      "Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America.",
      "In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front.",
      "It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu.",
      "There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan.",
      "In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?",
      "Fair question.",
      "But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go.",
      "Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.",
      "Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"?",
      "What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through.",
      "And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast.",
      "That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.",
      "She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day.",
      "Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008.",
      "In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts."

      "The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans.",
      "For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts.",

      "In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations.",
      "So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days?",
      "Here are some answers: .",
      "The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia.",
      "Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia's only year-round seaports.",
      "Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million.",
      "However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan.",
      "By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire's security.",
      "Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire's capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders.",
      "Many of them ended up deported or assassinated.",
      "April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world.",
      "Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day.",
      "This is a major point of contention.",
      "Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire.",
      "But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million.",
      "Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922.",
      "Almost any way one can imagine.",
      "While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings.",
      "Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt.",
      "The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation.",
      "Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard.",
      "Rape, too, was frequently reported.",
      "In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, \"The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\"",
      "No.",
      "Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime.",
      "The word \"genocide\" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe.",
      "He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing.",
      "Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.",
      "The definition included acts meant \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"",
      "Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada.",
      "Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings.",
      "Turkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations.",
      "A U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word.",
      "Also, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had \"inhumane consequences.\"",
      "While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word \"genocide,\" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians."

      "\"Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit.",

      "(CNN)Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday.",
      "Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse.",
      "The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity.",
      "Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced.",
      "He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.",
      "Two charges against his diocese were dropped.",
      "At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\"",
      "Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications.",
      "\"We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,\" Baker said.",
      "The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges.",
      "Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said.",
      "In those interceding months, the priest kept on working.",
      "And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction.",
      "The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning.",
      "Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese.",
      "\"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\" O'Malley said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November.",
      "\"There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis.\"",
      "Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments.",
      "Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities.",
      "But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there.",
      "\"It kind of shook Francis' reputation,\" said Moss.",
      "\"Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence.\"",
      "Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann.",
      "Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website.",
      "\"I pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the Diocese,\" Naumann said in an open letter to parishioners.",
      "\"All of us, who are privileged to serve in leadership for the Church, do so for only a season.",
      "It is not our Church, but Christ's Church.\"",
      "Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be \"very well received,\" though some may question why it took so long.",
      "\"It's not just that it's late,\" Moss said, \"but it's that Francis could have been more explicit.\"",
      "To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation \"in accordance with ... Canon Law.\"",
      "Anne Doyle, from the watchdog group that documents the Catholic church's abuse crisis, called Finn's removal \"a good step but just the beginning.\"",
      "\"The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability,\" Doyle said.",
      "\"... What no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children's safety his first priority.",
      "We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately.\"",

      "(CNN)Job one for newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of Freddie Gray, 25.",
      "Gray's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in Baltimore.",
      "Lynch's job won't be easy: As the nation's top law enforcement officer, she takes the reins of a Justice Department that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations, and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control.",
      "But as events in Baltimore demonstrate, too many local departments aren't getting the message.",
      "Lynch will need to put down the carrots, pick up the stick and make clear that the Justice Department intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons: the power to withhold federal funds from local departments.",
      "More about that in a moment.",
      "The first order of business will be to re-establish order in Baltimore, where the National Guard has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared.",
      "\"In the days ahead, I intend to work with leaders throughout Baltimore to ensure that we can protect the security and civil rights of all residents,\" Lynch said within hours of being sworn in on Monday.",
      "\"And I will bring the full resources of the Department of Justice to bear in protecting those under threat, investigating wrongdoing and securing an end to violence.\"",
      "A key part of that vow -- \"investigating wrongdoing\" -- must include a close look at the Baltimore Police Department, which has been the subject of bitter complaints of brutality.",
      "According to a major investigation by The Baltimore Sun published last fall, the city has paid out $5.7 million in court judgments or settlements to more than 100 people since 2011 in connection with allegations of brutality and/or violations of civil rights.",
      "\"Officers have battered dozens of residents who suffered broken bones -- jaws, noses, arms, legs, ankles -- head trauma, organ failure, and even death, coming during questionable arrests.",
      "Some residents were beaten while handcuffed; others were thrown to the pavement,\" the Sun expose says.",
      "\"And in almost every case, prosecutors or judges dismissed the charges against the victims -- if charges were filed at all.\"",
      "That kind of behavior helped set the stage for the riots and looting we now see.",
      "Lynch has already launched a probe of the death of Freddie Gray, and the Justice Department is also investigating the recent videotaped police killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, where an officer has been arrested and charged with murder.",
      "As attorney general, Lynch has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior.",
      "A Justice Department program called Community Oriented Policing Services, launched in 2011, helps local departments implement best practices.",
      "The COPS program's effectiveness will surely come under question, since Baltimore was one of the eight departments participating in the voluntary program.",
      "Lynch can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court-ordered reforms, a power conferred by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.",
      "The provision was a result of the 1991 videotaped police beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles cops and the riot that ensued when the officers were acquitted.",
      "The Obama administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the Clinton or Bush administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in Cleveland, Miami, and Ferguson, Missouri.",
      "But even those tough remedies may not be working, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues.",
      "\"Even where local leaders have embraced Washington's prescriptions, Justice Department officials have increasingly found themselves returning to grapple a second time with problems they thought they had fixed,\" writes reporter Simone Weichselbaum, noting that \"recurring problems have emerged in police departments in Miami, New Orleans and New Jersey, all of which had promised to carry out major changes in response to Justice Department investigations that turned up evidence of discriminatory policing.\"",
      "That leaves Lynch with a final, even tougher weapon: the power, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that engage in discriminatory practices.",
      "Lynch's predecessor as attorney general, Eric Holder, generally refrained from yanking funds, although in 2013 he did deny drug forfeiture money to the sheriff's office in Alamance County, North Carolina, claiming the department was unlawfully targeting Latinos for traffic stops.",
      "The sheriff of Alamance County sued the Justice Department and the case remains unresolved -- but it underscores the fact that Lynch has the power to press local departments, legally and financially, to curb local abuses.",
      "She should invoke the power where necessary and calm cities like Baltimore as the nation heads into what could be a long, hot summer of unrest."

      "(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap.",
      "In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning.",
      "Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace.",
      "Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated.",
      "It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few.",
      "When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control.",
      "The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights .",
      "I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal.",
      "Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts.",
      "Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut .",
      "Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day.",
      "Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over.",
      "That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed.",
      "In some respects, Republicans are right.",
      "Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative.",
      "The facts about the gender wage gap .",
      "But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender.",
      "Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor.",
      "Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears.",
      "And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand.",
      "Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls.",
      "But nothing could be further from the truth.",
      "Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest .",
      "The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats.",
      "In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war.",
      "It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday.",
      "But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do.",
      "The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond."

      "(CNN)A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a \"serial rapist\" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews.",
      "Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how \"flawed\" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases.",
      "CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience.",
      "They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing.",
      "Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, \"Carry That Weight,\" as part of her senior thesis.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing.",
      "During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a \"serial rapist\" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus.",
      "The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz \"transform her personal vendetta\" into a \"Columbia-sponsored calumny\" by supporting \"Carry That Weight\" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through \"this outrageous display of harassment and defamation.\"",
      "Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia.",
      "\"This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students.",
      "And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that.",
      "This is all very painful.\"",
      "The defendants \"had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation\" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims.",
      "\"By refusing to protect Paul Nungesser, Columbia University first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it.\"",
      "Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The school also declined to confirm the outcome of Nungesser's disciplinary proceedings.",
      "\"As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them,\" spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement.",
      "Kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets.",
      "The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, \"Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her,\" in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual.",
      "Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit.",
      "She also balked at the idea that Nungesser would sue the school or her professor \"for allowing me to make an art piece.\"",
      "\"It's ridiculous that he would read it as a 'bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia,\" Sulkowicz wrote in an email.",
      "\"If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?\"",
      "The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus.",
      "She's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help.\u200b .",
      "Nungesser's complaint seeks damages to be determined at trial for harm to his reputation, loss of educational opportunities and future career prospects.",
