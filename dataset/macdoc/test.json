      "The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest.",
      "The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest.",
      "In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer.",
      "\"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times.",
      "\"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it.",
      "It's very, very dangerous.",

      "It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year.",
      "The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected.",

      "The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons.",
      "\"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee.",
      "The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said.",
      "The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders.",

      "Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall.",

      "\"We picked it this morning from the hills of Lampedusa,\" he declares with a flourish, waving thin sprigs of wild asparagus under my nose.",
      "He demonstrates how you must break it apart with your fingers, bit by bit, until you get to the hard part, which you keep aside to boil down in water for the pasta sauce he is preparing with his shipmate, Enzo Idone.",
      "Cooking, however, may be a positive distraction from dark memories.",
      "How I was smuggled into Europe -- and why it was worth it .",
      "We boarded the Finance Police's ship, the Calabrese, in Lampedusa harbor earlier in the evening.",
      "The Calabrese regularly patrols the Mediterranean off Lampedusa, which is Italy's southernmost territory and just 70 miles, or just over 110 kilometers, from the Tunisian coast.",
      "In recent years, it has been the first point of entry to Europe for tens of thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East.",
      "A few years ago, the Calabrese was on the look out for \"contrabandisti,\" smugglers trafficking in cigarettes and drugs.",
      "But in recent years, its 12-man crew has joined Italy's effort to rescue migrants coming from Africa and the Middle East.",
      "We spend seven hours on board the ship, but nothing much happens.",
      "We see some Italian fishing boats the crew knew by sight.",
      "Shortly after sunset, the Calabrese's captain, Gianluca Busonera, begins calling out quick orders to his men as we approach a small boat.",
      "The easy-going crew seem to tense up.",
      "One man turns on a bright spotlight and focuses the beam on the boat, while another with powerful binoculars read out the name on the back.",
      "Busonera peers intently at the boat, which appears to be a fishing vessel, then shrugs.",
      "\"It's fine,\" he tells me.",
      "\"If it were low in the water, we'd know it was full of people, but this boat is riding high.\"",
      "He waves to the Tunisian boat, where an older man in a jacket waves back.",
      "Busonera gives him a thumbs up, and steers the ship to the right.",
      "It's a routine evening for the Calabrese, and that is just fine with the crew.",
      "They've seen enough troubles in their time to appreciate an uneventful day's work.",
      "Back in the galley, I ask Cortese about his worst experience while serving at sea with the Guardia di Finanza.",
      "He and most of his shipmates took part in the rescue effort on October 3, 2013, after a ship with hundreds of migrants had gone down off Lampedusa.",
      "More than 350 people died in that disaster.",
      "The crew of the Calabrese was able to rescue four of the survivors.",
      "Cortese's cheery demeanor suddenly becomes serious.",
      "\"I still remember pulling out of the water, with our hands, a young, pregnant woman who had just died,\" he recalls.",
      "\"There were children,\" adds his crewmate, Idone, shaking his head.",

      "It was a bad situation.",
      "I remember the body of a boy we recovered.",

      "Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy .",
      "Cortese and Idone stress that as fathers, there is nothing worse than having to see the bodies of dead children.",
      "\"At the moment,\" recalls Cortese, \"we were too busy to think about it, but when we go home, before going to sleep, it comes back to us.\"",
      "He emphasizes that he and his shipmates were just doing their duty as professional military men.",
      "Out in the Mediterranean, with no land in sight, you realize just how vast it is.",
      "And although it's been warm on land in Sicily recently, at night on the water, it's cold and windy.",
      "On board the Calabrese, we are warm, well-fed and in good company.",
      "The ship is well-maintained and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, allowing Busonera to plow confidently through the waves in the dark without fear of running into anything.",
      "It contrasts starkly with conditions migrants have recounted to us of the rickety boats and unseaworthy rubber dinghies they use to try to cross the Mediterranean.",
      "Often they're without food, water or shelter, their boat's crew inexperienced and untrained.",
      "That's if they have a crew at all.",
      "Many migrants have been beaten and robbed of all their possessions before they board.",
      "And unless a ship like the Calabrese comes to their rescue, death at sea is a definite possibility."

      "(CNN)Fifty years ago in Frankfurt, German prosecutors tried 22 former Nazi SS soldiers at Auschwitz in what remains the most famous Holocaust trial staged in Germany.",
      "At the time, Fritz Bauer, the German-Jewish attorney general of Hessen, expressed the simple hope that \"sooner or later, one of the accused would step forward and say: 'What took place -- it was horrific, I'm sorry.'",
      "Then the entire world would exhale, as would all the survivors of those killed at Auschwitz, and the air would be cleared.\"",
      "Sadly, Bauer observed, \"it has not been uttered, nor will it be.\"",
      "The refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of Holocaust trials.",
      "John Demjanjuk, whose conviction by a Munich court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, remained defiantly silent during his 18-month trial, never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse.",
      "Over the years, some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations, but have insisted that they played no role.",
      "Those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb.",
      "Over the years, an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that SS men had engaged in extermination out of duress.",
      "The results were astonishing: Investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a German officer or NCO had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide.",
      "Not one.",
      "These evasions and lies were often effective, as many German trials of Holocaust perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal.",
      "And even when a trial ended in a conviction, what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning, an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide.",
      "Fritz Bauer can now exhale.",
      "On April 21, on the opening day of his trial in L\u00fcneburg, where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 Jews during his service at Auschwitz, the 93-year-old Gr\u00f6ning faced the court and acknowledged, \"It is beyond question that I am morally complicit.",
      "This moral guilt I acknowledge here, before the victims, with regret and humility.\"",
      "If nothing else comes from the trial, that statement alone justifies the undertaking.",
      "Of course, in acknowledging his moral complicity, Gr\u00f6ning fell short of confessing legal guilt.",
      "Indeed, for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law, arguing, in an interview with Der Spiegel in 2005, that he had been no more than a \"cog in the gears.\"",
      "At Auschwitz, Gr\u00f6ning was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to Berlin.",
      "In performing this task, Gr\u00f6ning insists that he never engaged in cruel, murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true.",
      "But does this relieve him of criminal liability?",
      "For decades German courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under German law.",
      "In 2011, the Demjanjuk conviction changed that.",
      "In convicting Demjanjuk as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor death camp, the Munich court concluded that death camp guards, regardless of how they had conducted themselves, had to be accessories to murder, because that was their job.",
      "It was a crucial breakthrough, because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process.",
      "When it comes to factory-like genocide, guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness; guilt follows function.",
      "Convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the Munich court.",
      "By this standard, Gr\u00f6ning's truthful claim that he was no more than \"a cog\" constitutes an admission of guilt.",
      "This does not mean that Gr\u00f6ning deserves the same measure of punishment as an SS sadist.",
      "In fact, it's not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction.",
      "But without the court's conviction, Gr\u00f6ning's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete.",
      "The significance of Gr\u00f6ning's trial can be measured in one final way.",
      "Many have observed that it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.",
      "But it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort.",
      "April 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Ottomans during World War I, an event many have described as genocide.",
      "And yet the Turkish nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago.",
      "With that in mind, Gr\u00f6ning's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning."

      "It's double talk,\" said Gerald Gurney, a former athletic-academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport.",
      "\"If you look at their basic core principles, it's all about academics, the experience, the integration of academics, and the education of the student is paramount,\" Gurney said.",
      "\"They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths.\"",
      "The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement, which read in part: .",
      "The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field.",
      "\"This case is troubling for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them,\" said Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer.",
      "In its response to the lawsuit, it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association, and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately.",
      "The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who, over 18 years, were funneled into classes that never met, where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports.",
      "Mary Willingham, the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic, has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required.",
      "The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about, she says, is a sham.",
      "\"Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway?",
      "It makes no sense,\" said Willingham, who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called \"Cheated.\"",
      "\"If they can't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that, then why certify students semester after semester to play?",
      "It's lost its meaning for me.\"",
      "The NCAA's claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years, not just in the rhetoric on its website, but in speeches by its president, Mark Emmert, and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes.",
      "For example, before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses, the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism, insisting that college athletes are paid with an education.",
      "That's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler, seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value.",
      "In response, the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education: Consistent with \"its commitment to amateurism, member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws.\"",
      "Attorney Michael Hausfeld, who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes, said this: .",
      "\"This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes.",
      "NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that 'What we live for is the education of our athletes,' but the NCAA's record tells a far different story.\"",
      "But Rick Burton, professor of sport management at Syracuse University, said it's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country.",
      "\"I understand, I think, where the NCAA is coming from.",
      "We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University,\" he said.",
      "\"It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina, and there's no logic to that,\" he said.",
      "\"The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA.\"",
      "UNC, which was also sued, has admitted to the fraud, but also asked for a judge to throw out the case, saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the \"educational malpractice\" theory doesn't apply.",
      "UNC claims it is protected by state law.",
      "This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal.",
      "The NCAA, which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from \"dangerous and exploitive athletic practices,\" now says it does not enforce health and safety rules.",
      "In fact, in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011, the NCAA wrote: \"The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes.\"",
      "A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken.",
      "It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL.",
      "Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, and a leading thorn in the NCAA's side for decades, said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all.",
      "\"There's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society.",
      "One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it doesn't protect players?",
      "If it doesn't play a role in the education of college athletics?",
      "It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption.\""

      "This is the warning the world deserves to hear.",
      "Because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century: the fruits of radical Islam.",
      "The results of the Obama White House's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical Islam in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia.",
      "Not to mention here in the United States, Canada and Europe.",
      "Is it not a tragic irony that the Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater while leaving Libya a failed state and Yemen a failing state?",
      "The Syrian jihad gave rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which now uses Syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in Iraq, which could soon spill over into Jordan.",
      "Plus, Libya is now being used as a rear operating base by ISIS and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the Middle East, even as they plan attacks in Europe and North America.",
      "Given the frightfully slow pace America's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both ISIS and its progenitor, al Qaeda, the picture of what's in store is clear: The body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas.",
      "And neither the United States nor our Western allies are immune to this cancer.",
      "Academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of ISIS and al Qaeda as distinctly different.",
      "But the fact is they are not -- their agendas, which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today, are manifestations of radical Islam.",
      "Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven na\u00efve, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is, but as they hope it could be.",
      "There is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world's most powerful politician and his national security team.",
      "Just take the National Strategy for Counterterrorism published by the White House in 2011.",
      "That document contained the assertion that, \"Since the beginning of 2011, the transformative change sweeping North Africa and the Middle East -- along with the death of Osama bin Laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat, par-ticularly as the relevance of al Qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished.\"",
      "Yet, fast forward to January 2014 and America's top intelligence official, director of National Intelligence James Clapper, advised Congress that al Qaeda was no less capable of threatening the United States and our allies than a decade earlier.",
      "Soon after Clapper acknowledged al Qaeda was not a band on the run, as President Obama had described the terrorist enterprise, a report by terrorism expert Seth Jones of the RAND Corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the White House:  As restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like Libya, Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring, those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al Qaeda and groups aligned with it.",
      "According to data compiled by Jones, from 2010 through 2013, the number of Salafi jihadist groups increased by 58%.",
      "These groups are fueled by Salafiyya Jihadiyya, an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al Qaeda, but is the source code for the agenda of the al Qaeda offshoot ISIS.",
      "Most recently, absent from the National Security Strategy produced by the Obama White House in February 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al Qaeda.",
      "Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed on President Obama's watch.",
      "But contrary to what the White House seemed to think in 2011, bin Laden's death has not lifted the shadow he casts over America's, or our allies' security.",
      "Indeed, within days of our new National Security Strategy's publication date, in the seventh issue of ISIS's English-language magazine Dabiq, the group's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin Laden, while accusing his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, of steering al Qaeda off the path of its former leader.",
      "Meanwhile, Yemen -- home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the al Qaeda branch that claimed credit for the January 2015 attack in Paris at the office of Charlie Hebdo -- has also become a failed state.",
      "AQAP is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al Qaeda writ large, and the Obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al Qaeda's global network.",
      "So it is interesting that, in the months before the Yemeni government was overthrown by Iran-backed rebels, President Obama described the U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al Qaeda -- interesting because the President did not do more to help that \"partner\" government remain in power.",
      "Once again, the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the Middle East.",
      "What were they thinking?",
      "And how do they plan to combat AQAP now?",
      "Despite what the White House wants the world to believe, a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities: .",
      "ISIS controls a large amount of territory in the Middle East, and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as Libya and Afghanistan, while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the West.",
      "And, although ISIS is trying to \"out al Qaeda\" al Qaeda, resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world, al Qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the United States and our allies today than it was in January 2014.",
      "At the same time, the routine failures of President Obama and his advisers to understand the security environment, and to appropriately tailor America's national security posture in a manner demanded by it, foretells more disasters lie ahead.",
      "Not only Americans, but also our allies should be very, very afraid.",
      "Indeed, President Obama's refusal to simply call a problem like radical Islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical Islamist groups.",
      "History has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders don't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it.",
      "President Obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that.",
      "But if he wants to help define a future for the Middle East and North Africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions, he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes-men surrounding him at the White House.",
      "There is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with Pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe.",
      "Indeed, President Obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from Arab states are saying behind closed doors.",
      "Most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating ISIS and al Qaeda.",
      "However, all of them recognize that, unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better, the United States will have to deploy considerably more of our \"kinetic\" resources to put those victories in sight.",
      "This does not mean a ground forces-intensive response is required from us at this time.",
      "But if the President thinks it prudent to wait on our Arab partners to do most of the heavy lifting, he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not-too-distant future."

      "(CNN)The lawyer for Robert Bates, an Oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a Taser, on Saturday released  documents that he says verify some of Bates' training as a law enforcement officer.",
      "The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun.",
      "His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public.",
      "\"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN.",
      "Read the documents .",
      "CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic.",
      "Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office to provide his training records.",
      "The sheriff's office has turned down CNN's requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation.",
      "Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood's statements.",
      "The documents are important because Bates' training has become a central issue in the case.",
      "The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff.",
      "The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused.",
      "The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations.",
      "The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014.",
      "Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state.",
      "Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser.",
      "Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff's office records that Bates obtained, Wood said.",
      "He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said.",
      "Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris.",
      "Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing.",
      "Bates is free on $25,000 bond.",
      "He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead.",
      "\"I shot him!",
      "I'm sorry!\"",
      "Bates is heard saying on video of the incident.",
      "Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense.",
      "In an interview Friday with the \"Today\" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies.",
      "\"That is absolutely the truth.",
      "I have it in writing,\" he told the show.",
      "Questions have already been raised about Bates' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office started.",
      "In his statement to investigators, Bates said he \"became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007.\"",
      "Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff's office in late 2007 or 2008.",
      "But the sheriff's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008.",
      "Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an \"advanced\" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be.",
      "Questions have been raised about Bates' firearms qualifications scores.",
      "To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said.",
      "Documents with a heading \"Firearms Qualification Record\" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days.",
      "But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff's office, Wood said.",
      "The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says it can't find the records.",
      "The department's summary of Bates' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times.",
      "\"If you're going to forge somebody's score why not give them a 90 or a 95,\" Wood said.",
      "CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World.",
      "Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn't undercut the World's reporting.",
      "\"These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story,\" she said Saturday.",
      "Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days.",
      "The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014.",
      "Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes.",
      "\"It's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes,\" he said.",
      "Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates.",
      "One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: \"Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well.\"",
      "His weakness: \"Radio usage/geography.\"",
      "Remedial training: \"Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on.",
      "Will have to work on his geography skills.",
      "Both will be remedied in time!\""

Frances described the song as a summary of the late Kurt's life including the struggle with drugs and feeling unworthy to be used as the generation's voice. Frances recalls how famous Kurt was back in the day to the point that when they would be driving to a place, Kurt's song would always be playing on the radio. This made Frances quite nervous and Frances says being a fan would make it even more strange. Death made Kurt twice as famous and sales went even higher compared to the time when Kurt was alive. Many came to pay homage to the achievements of Kurt Cobain. Frances speaks about the criticism received for being an executive producer of \"Montage of Heck\" at the tender age of only 22 years. Frances does not shy away from speaking about Kurt Cobain's history and the influence that Kurt had over a large group of people.

      "(CNN)The White House insists it doesn't need congressional approval for the Iran nuclear deal announced this month.",
      "But while historical precedent suggests the President might indeed have the authority to move forward without Congress, the Obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history: Getting Congress' signature might be worth the effort.",
      "True, the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy.",
      "But it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive-based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch -- a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of Congress.",
      "The President and his advisers have avoided using the term \"treaty,\" instead explaining that it would be a \"nonbinding agreement.\"",
      "According to Secretary of State John Kerry: \"We've been very clear from the beginning.",
      "We're not negotiating a 'legally binding plan.'",
      "We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement.\"",
      "On \"Meet the Press,\" Kerry said, \"What we're looking for is not to have Congress interfere with our ability, inappropriately, by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the President.\"",
      "There is a big legal argument that will play out over these definitional issues, with the potential for court challenges.",
      "But outside of the legal debate, there are also significant political questions, and those are a different beast altogether.",
      "For a start, there is growing pressure on Capitol Hill -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give Congress the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions.",
      "On Tuesday, a deal was reached on legislation proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker that would require President Barack Obama to submit the final deal to Congress, giving it 52 days to review and approve the agreement.",
      "Corker told MSNBC on Tuesday that negotiators had reached a \"bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact, full of integrity.\"",
      "What's in the Iran bill and why all the fuss?",
      "There is good reason for Obama to avoid calling this a treaty.",
      "After all, given the contentious political environment on Capitol Hill, where legislators struggle to pass even a routine budget, the notion that they would move on a treaty of this importance seems dubious at best.",
      "But there is also a history of Congress causing significant trouble for important international treaties.",
      "In the late 1970s, for example, President Jimmy Carter tried to obtain consent for the SALT II treaties, but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that Carter was weak on defense.",
      "Carter pushed for the treaties as essential to international peace but to no avail.",
      "After Iranians took American hostages and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the treaties died in the Senate.",
      "Yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment, presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political  capital, and even once the White House exited the struggle bruised and battered, the historic treaties endured.",
      "Top GOP, Dem senators say Iran compromise reached .",
      "This was the case with another treaty that Carter asked the Senate to ratify: the Panama Canal Treaties of 1978.",
      "Carter decided that turning authority of the canal over to Panama was essential to regional peace and stability.",
      "He knew this would be tough sell, and Tennessee Republican Howard Baker for his part predicted he wouldn't even get 20 votes as conservative groups coordinated their campaign through the Committee to Save the Panama Canal and the Emergency Coalition to Save the Panama Canal.",
      "Indeed, they dispatched speakers to warn that the deal would give the Soviets a foothold in the region.",
      "However, Carter countered aggressively, both on a personal level -- helping secure the vote of Sen. Richard Stone of Florida by sending a personal letter to the senator, dispatching experts to Florida to answer the questions of constituents and addressing audiences through state-of-the-art telephone hookups.",
      "In the end, the Senate ratified the treaties by one vote more than the required two-thirds majority, although Carter also paid a political price after energizing the right during the fight.",
      "President Ronald Reagan faced a similar challenge.",
      "Toward the end of his presidency, he reached a historic breakthrough on intercontinental ballistic missiles with the Soviet Union.",
      "Yet despite excitement in the White House and across the nation about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Washington in December 1987, many conservatives blasted the decision, arguing that Reagan had betrayed the conservative cause.",
      "During a meeting at the White House, eight Republican senators who opposed the treaty shared their feelings with Reagan.",
      "Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, one of Reagan's closest allies, said: \"The Soviets have broken most every treaty they have ever signed.",
      "... How do we assure compliance with the new treaty?\"",
      "Right-wing organizations, meanwhile, compared Reagan with Neville Chamberlain.",
      "Reagan responded with an aggressive effort to halt their rebellion.",
      "In a hearing on the treaty, Secretary of State George Shultz attacked North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, who had accused Reagan of \"confusion, misstatements and ... even misrepresentation.\"",
      "He met with Republicans, spoke with reporters and lobbied the public to endorse the deal.",
      "Despite their protests, most Republicans eventually came around.",
      "On May 27, 1988, the Senate ratified the treaty 93-5.",
      "Helms, one of the few to vote against the treaty, admitted they were \"licked.\"",
      "And the treaty, which marked the beginning of the end for the Cold War, has endured.",
      "The reality is that the signature of Congress is still worth a lot in American politics -- the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president.",
      "Congressional support also makes the strength of the treaty greater in the eyes of leaders overseas.",
      "All this will be true with Iran, especially as many members of Obama's own party are leery about the agreement.",
      "Ultimately, the President probably has the right to go his own way with this, and his frustration with Congress might create strong incentives for doing so.",
      "But in the long term, persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war -- and would help prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power.",
      "The good news is that there have been some statements from the White House that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of Congress in a solid deal.",
      "Now it's time to see if the administration follows through."

      "Only two major airports in the U.S. -- Miami and Orlando -- require employees to be screened through metal detectors, a CNN investigation found earlier this year.",
      "As a result of the report, TSA Secretary Jeh Johnson announced immediate actions, including criminal background checks every two years for all airport aviation workers, screening of airline and airport employees traveling as passengers, reduction of access points to secure areas at all airports and increased random screening of aviation employees.",
      "Johnson requested the TSA study after a Delta Air Lines ramp worker and passenger at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were arrested in December for allegedly smuggling guns onto flights to New York.",
      "Since the incident, the airport has hired private security to check the bags of employees when they show up for work and has increased overall security.",
      "\"Immediately following the incident in December 2014, TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,\" Johnson said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Charles Schumer called Johnson's announcement \"a prompt response and a significant first step to closing the gaping loopholes in airport security, especially with regard to reducing access points and enhancing criminal background checks.\"",
      "Specifically, the TSA report said employee vetting should be strengthened by \"updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses, instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and DHS data sources, and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause.\"",
      "In addition, the TSA should expand the collection of domestic intelligence, which would include monitoring social media, and expand national reward programs to encourage employees to report security issues, the report said.",
      "\"Although there is no perfect security system, the multiple layers -- which can be routinely enhanced or modified -- provide an effective means to secure passengers, employees and facilities,\" the report said.",
      "It also recommended increased surveillance of employees who work inside baggage rooms and cargo areas.",

      "Rep. John Katko, R-New York and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security, said, \"As threats to aviation security continue to evolve, it is critical that the Transportation Security Administration, as well as the airport community, are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats.",

      "\"Screening every single employee may not be a cure-all solution, but every single employee should come to work every day with reason to expect that they'll face random screening and inspections,\" she said.",
      "Lauren Stover, security director at Miami International Airport, told CNN, \"We support the findings of the committee and agree that there is no single solution in mitigating the insider threat, however we will continue our employee screening program as we believe that physical screening is a critical component to a layered security program.\"",

      "I'm sorry.",
      "I know it sucks!...But you just gotta stay strong.\"",
      "Messages between the two flew back and forth.",
      "They realized they were falling in love.",
      "For most other couples, the next step would be to meet in person.",
      "But for Katie and Dalton, that was complicated -- and dangerous.",
      "Cystic fibrosis patients shouldn't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs.",
      "Dr. Michael Anstead at the University of Kentucky, Katie's pulmonologist since she was a little girl, had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other CF patients were a bad idea.",
      "In their online conversations, one of the first things Dalton told Katie about himself was that he had Burkholderia cepacia, a horribly dangerous infection for people with CF.",
      "\"I was like, 'Hi, I'm Dalton from Missouri and I have Burkholderia cepacia,' because it's such a big deal in the CF community,\" he remembers.",
      "\"I left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her.\"",
      "Katie listened to her heart, even if it might hurt her lungs.",
      "She asked Dalton to come visit her in Flemingsburg, Kentucky.",
      "\"I told Dalton I'd rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years,\" Katie says.",
      "\"That was definitely something I had to think about, but when you have those feelings, you just know.\"",
      "So on August 28, 2009, Dalton drove more than six hours from St. Charles, Missouri, to Katie's hometown in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where they'd arranged to meet at the Dairy Queen.",
      "At 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- Katie got out of her car and saw Dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses.",
      "\"My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello,\" she remembers.",
      "\"I'm usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right.\"",
      "Katie took Dalton and his mother, Renee, who'd made the trip with him, to have dinner with her and her parents, Debbie and John Donovan.",
      "Later the young couple drove around Flemingsburg, and Dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday, which was two days before.",
      "Their health quickly deteriorated, and within months, the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time.",
      "Too ill to work, Dalton quit his job at his family's auto repair shop, and Katie quit hers as a store clerk.",
      "In August, 2014, the couple entered the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center together to wait for new lungs.",
      "Dalton's came first, and on November 17, he had his transplant.",
      "Despite his Burkholderia cepacia, which makes transplants more complicated, it was a success.",
      "\"I was so thrilled.",
      "I was so happy for him,\" Katie says.",
      "The month after Dalton's surgery, UPMC discharged Katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while.",
      "When she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital, but  UPMC informed her she'd used up her supply of Medicare days and wouldn't accept her.",
      "Medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- wouldn't pay for another hospitalization until Katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days.",
      "But Katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days, much less sixty.",
      "So Katie relied on Medicaid, public insurance that was supplied by her home state of Kentucky.",
      "She was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, where she was cared for by Anstead, her beloved pulmonologist.",
      "But then, another hurdle.",
      "Anstead explained that most lung transplant centers, including the two in Kentucky, don't do transplants on patients with Burkholderia cepacia, referring them to larger centers like UPMC that have more experience with such complicated cases.",
      "Katie and Dalton, now 24 and 23, were desperate.",
      "Her doctors predicted she wouldn't live a year without new lungs.",
      "Going on her husband's private insurance wasn't an option, since Dalton is on his father's policy.",
      "In February, Anstead wrote a letter to Medicaid, pleading with them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care at UPMC, even though it was out of state.",
      "Kentucky Medicaid denied his plea, and that's when the squabbling began.",
      "In a statement to CNN, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services pointed the finger at UPMC, saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider.",
      "\"Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,\" wrote the spokeswoman, Gwenda Bond.",
      "\"Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.\"",
      "UPMC counters that Kentucky Medicaid told them that if they want to care for Katie, they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients.",
      "While UPMC spokeswoman Wendy Zellner didn't elaborate, a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state Medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low.",
      "Asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid is \"an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state Medicaid programs,\" Zellner wrote.",
      "\"UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation.\"",
      "Today, Katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed, hoping that the three parties -- Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs.",

      "Nobody should have to do that.\"",
      "If Katie doesn't get her transplant, not only will she die, but she'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection, which could be deadly for him as he's on drugs to suppress his immune system.",
      "As a result of inquiries from CNN, on Wednesday Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services arranged for a caseworker to call Katie at the hospital.",
      "But it didn't go very well.",
      "Katie says the caller, who identified herself as Pat Pierorazio, was \"rude, mean, and angry.\"",
      "\"She said someone had told her to call me, and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me,\" she says.",
      "Katie says the Medicare representative told her she would look into her situation.",
      "In a statement, Albright with CMS wrote to CNN: \"We are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs.",
      "CMS is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible.\"",
      "Caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance, Katie tries to stay strong, just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first Facebook conversation.",

John Delaney organized meetings with everyone from the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Pakistani ambassador in Washington. Cardin also sent a letter with Sen. Barbara Mikulski to President Barack Obama calling for greater efforts to secure Weinstein's life. However, three years after Warren's deprivation of liberty, the White House announced Weinstein had been accidentally killed. Elaine stated that the government assistance was inconsistent and disappointing during those three years. Delaney was saddened by the little effort shown by Obama's administration and blamed the disjointed system.",

      "And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy.",

      "That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive.",

      "\"It's so easy to drink that you forget you're drinking alcohol.",
      "It's very sweet.",
      "You hardly taste the whiskey at all,\" said Zachary Jones, a bartender at Community Smith in Atlanta.",
      "\"I've known people who can't do shots, but they can do Fireball.\"",
      "Fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women, many of whom say they like that it doesn't singe their throat and leaves a Dentyne-like aftertaste.",
      "But not everyone is a fan.",
      "Whiskey enthusiasts -- the types who can talk knowledgeably about single-malt Scotches -- mostly turn up their noses at the stuff.",
      "\"I've got to be honest: It's not anything I'd reach for, at any occasion,\" Bryson said.",
      "\"But clearly I'm not in the mainstream.\"",
      "Fireball wasn't always Fireball.",
      "It used to be known as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky before its maker, the Sazerac Co., rebranded it in 2006.",
      "Sales were modest until about five years ago, when Sazerac hired a \"national brand ambassador,\" Richard Pomes, to spread the word about Fireball through event planning and bartender outreach.",
      "In other words, Pomes traveled the country serving up Fireball shots in bars.",
      "He started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures, such as Austin and Nashville, and then spread to other places.",
      "Everywhere he went, Pomes shared his Fireballing exploits on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and encouraged patrons to do the same.",
      "Soon, Fireball started gaining traction.",
      "Then it exploded.",
      "Retail sales jumped from just under $2 million in 2011 to $63 million in 2013 to $130 million last year, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm.",
      "Along the way, Sazerac has cultivated a party-hearty social ethos around Fireball, encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as #WhiskyWednesday.",
      "The brand has more than 85,000 followers on Twitter and another 43,000 on Instagram -- more than twice the social reach of Jagermeister -- although on Twitter, it still trails Jack Daniel's whiskey and Patron tequila.",
      "And it got a boost in October when someone taped a GoPro camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception.",
      "The resulting video has more than 2.3 million YouTube views.",
      "\"Our fans love it, and they spread the word.",
      "The Fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing,\" said Amy Preske, public relations and events manager for Sazerac, who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand's booming popularity.",
      "\"We are very excited and humbled.\"",
      "So is Fireball a future cornerstone of every well-stocked bar or just a fad?",
      "It may be too soon to say.",
      "Retail sales remain strong, according to IRI, although Fireball's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months.",
      "But it's under siege from several fronts.",
      "The past year has brought copycats Jim Beam Kentucky Fire and Jack Daniels Tennessee Fire, both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup, along with cinnamon vodkas, cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs.",
      "Fireball also endured a public-relations mess last fall when several European countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients: propylene glycol, a chemical used in a variety of food products, e-cigarettes and antifreeze.",
      "Sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in Fireball \"in very small quantities\" -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the FDA (PDF) -- and reassured customers that Fireball is \"absolutely safe to drink.\"",
      "Then there's the question of whether Fireball will become a victim of its own success.",
      "Young consumers are notoriously fickle, and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it.",
      "\"It just reached a point where I couldn't drink it anymore,\" said Jones, the Atlanta bartender.",
      "\"I think it was the sugar.\"",
      "Still, its popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather.",
      "Glasses are raised, someone makes a toast, and down go shots of an orange, syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction.",
      "\"It's an easy shot.",
      "You can drink a lot of them.",
      "With Fireball, you don't need a chaser,\" said Kelvin Davis, a bartender at the Nook in Atlanta.",
      "\"It's the one thing I can throw out there and it never fails.\""

      "But over the last decade, with fit golfers like Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, and now Jordan Spieth all winning the Masters, the training perspective on golf is shifting.",
      "There's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing, which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers.",
      "During the Masters, Spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries: mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation.",
      "Equally important, he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility.",
      "Related: Yoga for triathletes .",
      "Remember Tiger Wood's low-back problem earlier this year?",
      "Tiger blamed a lack of glute (primary buttock muscle) firing for locking up his back, but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue.",
      "When golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips, they compensate with their low back and knees, which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury.",
      "Want the mobility to swing like Spieth and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers?",
      "Try these three yoga-based moves I use with my PGA clients to address the key areas of the swing.",

      "Inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes (as pictured).",

      "Lie prone (belly down) on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders.",
      "Exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back.",
      "At the same time, move your shoulder blades down toward your waist.",
      "This will activate the mid-back muscles essential for thoracic spine extension while inhibiting the muscles of your upper neck and chest that limit mobility.",
      "Hold the posture for three long, deep breaths.",

      "Exhale as you sit back into a squat with your hands and forearms together in front of your chest.",
      "Inhale as you hold the position, ensuring that your low back doesn't arch, and your glutes and core are activated for support.",

      "Keep your hips and low back stable.",
      "Avoid separating your knees or letting one drop forward.",
      "Inhale as you use your bottom elbow for leverage to reach your top elbow upward while pulling your hands toward the center of your chest.",

      "But it's up to you to add skill to the movement.",
      "To that end, there are many golf trainers who focus on body mechanics with skill training.",
      "According to its website, the Titleist Performance Institute (TPI) educates instructors on \"how a properly functioning body allows a player to swing a golf club in the most efficient way possible.\"",
      "So, if you really want to swing like Spieth, you might consider hiring a TPI-certified trainer since the training staff Spieth thanked during his Masters victory speech were all TPI certified."

      "Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in \"mutual combat situation\" where he used his car as deadly weapon.",

      "Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30.",
      "The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur.",
      "Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996.",
      "Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions.",
      "That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.",
      "In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards."

      "President Obama briefly met his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, on Friday night at a dinner for the dozens of Latin American leaders convening in Panama City for the Summit of the Americas.",
      "This was historic.",
      "The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years.",
      "The meeting was so important that Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokesperson, issued a statement: \"At the Summit of the Americas this evening, President Obama and President Castro greeted each other and shook hands.\"",
      "Cuba and the United States had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart.",
      "Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern U.S. history, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs and the Mariel boatlift of 1980.",
      "But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face.",
      "Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with the Cuban leader before heading to Panama.",
      "They met Friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on Saturday when the summit begins in earnest.",
      "Obama arrived in Panama late Thursday for the conference, which in years past was tinged with animosity at Cuba's exclusion.",
      "Moments after Marine One, Obama's helicopter, touched down in Panama City, Castro's plane landed on the same tarmac.",
      "Panamanian television carried both arrivals live.",
      "During their phone call Wednesday, Obama and Castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes.",
      "He said it \"made sense\" for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions Friday and Saturday.",
      "Those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the United States and Cuba since a meeting between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and then-Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959.",
      "\"We're in new territory here,\" Rhodes said on Friday.",
      "\"The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation, focused totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\"",
      "Obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference, after announcing in December he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel.",
      "In Panama, Obama is expected to announce he's removing Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries.",
      "The State Department delivered its report on the designation to the White House on Wednesday; Obama said on Thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination.",
      "The White House isn't ruling out a final decision before Obama leaves Panama late Saturday night.",
      "In remarks during a brief stopover in Jamaica on Thursday, Obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove Cuba from the list, which also includes Iran, Sudan and Syria.",
      "\"Throughout this process, our emphasis has been on the facts,\" Obama said.",
      "\"So we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism, that when we make those designations we've got strong evidence that, in fact, that's the case.\"",
      "\"As circumstances change, then that list will change as well,\" he said.",
      "While some inside Cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw, U.S. officials say they're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties, which the White House argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region.",
      "Obama said in Jamaica he \"never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself.\"",
      "The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government.",
      "Even as Obama landed in Panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists was on full display.",
      "Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the Cuban government.",
      "Rhodes said the White House had \"expressed serious concerns\" about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island."

      "That's true too, sort of.",
      "In Skinner v. Oklahoma, the Court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional, but not because it was cruel and unusual.",
      "Instead, the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes.",
      "So the question remains: Is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional?",
      "The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"",
      "Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary.",
      "We have executed people with hangings and by firing squad.",
      "Sterilization has to be somewhere below that, right?",
      "Ultimately, however, the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis, because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the Constitution, it is permissible, if you willingly choose it.",
      "Suppose arguendo (for argument's sake) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment.",
      "This is where it gets interesting: It still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal.",

      "You waive your Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle's trunk.",
      "So then, if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights, can we waive our Eighth Amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment, even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional?",
      "And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals?",
      "Nope.",
      "Sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country, and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure.",
      "If sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional, and we've been doing it for a while, then that begs the question: Why the outrage now?",
      "Why the story that a Tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced?",
      "There are really only two possibilities.",
      "First, some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news.",
      "Second, even if we knew about it, we didn't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference.",
      "Most of the sterilization defendants are men.",
      "Search your feelings, Luke.",
      "When we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters, the idea of castration as punishment doesn't sound so bad right?",
      "Be honest: Let go of your \"we're-all-equal-in-all-ways\" banner for a moment.",
      "After all, not too long ago, execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions.",
      "So if we're OK with the gas chamber, we're probably OK with a snip.",

      "So far you're not ruling it out.",
      "And what if it's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17-year-old student?",
      "Most of our gut feelings shifted from \"maybe\" to \"no\" just now.",
      "It's OK to admit that, too.",
      "Of course, sterilization won't prevent a female sex offender from offending again, no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again.",
      "But the point is, somehow, the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal.",
      "Maybe it's that on a primal, unconscious level, what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man.",
      "Even if you're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a \"shocking\" news story, you must concede it fits.",
      "Why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar, but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty?",
      "Of course, we have to consider the related justification.",
      "Overall, a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women.",

      "After the announcement, they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.",
      "Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity.",
      "In his first day on the campaign trail, Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted.",
      "That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s.",
      "Their greatest virtue, their immense skills as politicians, has often come back to haunt them.",
      "Bill Clinton was attacked as \"slick Willie\" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism.",
      "When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq, many Democrats didn't buy her critique of President George W. Bush's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead.",
      "When she conducted her \"listening tour\" of New York before running for the Senate, many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider.",
      "When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email, some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn't always telling us what she was really about.",
      "Even if she isn't hiding anything, she often gives that appearance.",
      "During the next few months, Clinton will also have to connect with her party's base.",
      "The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton's candidacy.",
      "While they will probably vote for her, they are not very motivated and don't trust that she will stand for Democratic values.",
      "She will need to address these concerns, not through her style but through her agenda.",
      "Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing.",
      "She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran.",
      "Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large.",
      "Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance, for instance -- that won't be aimed at male candidates.",
      "Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism.",
      "But the struggle will be tough.",
      "Finally, and this relates to the last challenge, Clinton will have to contend with her husband.",
      "To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail, one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation.",
      "But he can also be liability.",
      "As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control.",
      "When he speaks his mind, as he did in dismissive comments about Obama's candidacy, it can often work against her.",
      "The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest, and ongoing stories about his personal life, as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago, could re-emerge on the campaign trail.",
      "Whether that is fair or not is beside the point: Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail.",
      "Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate.",
      "But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months."

      "(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.",
      "The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream.",
      "With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.",
      "Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.",
      "He holds little appeal to Latino voters.",
      "And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep.",
      "Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate \"Gang of 8\" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.",
      "He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border.",
      "His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.",
      "That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters.",
      "Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.",
      "He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.",
      "He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a \"horrifying precedent.\"",
      "Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.",
      "No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, \"We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.\"",
      "So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken.",
      "At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against \"one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday.\"",
      "But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.",
      "Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous.",
      "He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.",
      "Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.",
      "Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.",
      "By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership.",
      "Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.",
      "He is a fierce opponent of \"Obamacare\" and wants the law repealed.",
      "However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.",
      "(In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for \"Obamacare\" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.)",
      "Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.",
      "And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.",
      "Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.",
      "But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.",
      "In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico.",
      "Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.",
      "Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.",
      "Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.",
      "By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.",
      "With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.",
      "Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters."

      "(CNN)Prison life won't be pretty for Aaron Hernandez, the former NFL player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole.",
      "After correction officers evaluate him, he will be shipped to Massachusetts' flagship maximum-security prison, one of the most high-tech jails in the United States with no history of breakouts: the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, about 40 miles outside downtown Boston.",
      "It's called Souza, for short, and it's the state's newest prison, opened in 1998, with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire.",
      "\"I don't know the date, but he'll be going there.",
      "That's the maximum-security facility,\" Department of Corrections spokesman Darren Duarte said.",
      "Legal advocates for inmates describe Souza as sterile and violent at once.",
      "Its diverse demographic includes the young and the old, many of whom are also doing life.",
      "One stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates, the legal advocates said.",
      "\"It's very shiny and clean looking and very sterile,\" said Leslie Walker, executive director of Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, who has been visiting the Souza prison about every six weeks for the past 15 years and serves indigent prisoners there.",
      "But, she added: \"It is a very dangerous prison that is right now experiencing a veritable flood of opiates.\"",
      "Officials said Hernandez, 25, is being processed at the maximum-security Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Cedar Junction in Walpole, just a handful of miles from Gillette Stadium, where he once played tight end for the New England Patriots under a five-year $40 million contract.",
      "The prison system has yet to determine where to initially place Hernandez in Souza: solitary confinement; the less harsh but restricted block; the general population; a privileged section known as the \"lifers block,\" for those serving a life sentence; or the \"kitchen block,\" for those who work in the prison kitchen.",
      "\"At this point in time, we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of Hernandez is complete,\" Duarte said.",
      "\"Right now, he'll be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door, but they will figure all that out.\"",
      "Hernandez was sent immediately for processing after Wednesday's sentencing and jury conviction, Duarte said.",
      "A news outlet helicopter followed Hernandez's transfer to MCI Cedar Junction.",
      "Prison officials will be concerned about Hernandez's safety and whether any enemies, gangs or headline-seeking inmates will try to hurt Hernandez, who will become Souza's most famous resident.",
      "\"There could be prisoners with a beef who are out to get him,\" Walker said.",
      "\"Then he's going to have to be separated, and it's going to be challenging for prison officers and perhaps for him.",
      "\"The good news is that the superintendent of Souza-Baranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being, who I'm sure will do everything he can to keep Mr. Hernandez safe,\" Walker added.",
      "\"The person at the top sets the tone.",
      "He's fairly new and he's doing everything he can to make sure the prison is as safe as possible.\"",
      "That superintendent, Osvaldo Vidal, couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.",
      "Because of his celebrity, Hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards, said Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high- and minimum-security prisons.",
      "\"There will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is, but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star,\" said Levine, who founded Wall Street Prison Consultants, which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison.",
      "In the long run, however, it may not matter much in what section of the prison Hernandez does his time.",
      "About 90% of the inmates in the maximum-security prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day, said Walker, the legal advocate.",
      "\"It's pretty grim,\" Walker said.",
      "Souza has slightly larger cells than most other Massachusetts prisons, but not by much, Walker said.",
      "Even so, the cells are stark, small rooms of painted cinder-block walls with metal fixtures: a bunk mounted to the wall, a toilet and sink combination, a small writing shelf attached to the wall, and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor, Walker said.",
      "There's also a shelf for a small television, which must have a clear back for easy inspection, Walker said.",
      "With the exception of the TV, which inmates can buy for under $200, all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them, she said.",
      "There are two windows: one roughly 4 by 20 inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall, building or trees, and a tiny window on the cell door, which has two slots, for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door, she said.",
      "\"There's very little to do,\" Walker said of inmate life.",
      "\"It was built as a punishment facility.",
      "The thing in corrections is that you don't want people to like it there.",
      "Some people have been there since it opened, and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both.\"",
      "To combat opiate use among inmates, prison guards use narcotics-sniffing dogs for inspections, Walker said.",
      "\"It's pretty pathetic.",
      "I have clients (in Souza prison) who are heroin addicts who are trying to get clean,\" Walker said.",
      "There also are gangs in the prison, she said.",
      "As for violence, one elderly inmate was beaten to death last year, Walker said.",
      "If Hernandez finds himself in solitary confinement, it won't be pleasant, Walker said.",
      "\"Solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in.",
      "The lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad,\" Walker said.",
      "Initially, \"prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety, but I hope not,\" Walker said.",
      "\"It's very hard time.\"",

      "In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous.",
      "Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard.",

Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez even said Gray gave in to the arrest without the use of force.

Police reported that Gray had asked for medical attention as well as an inhaler before an ambulance came for Gray. It is not apparent why the police officers didn't call for medical services earlier. These events, unfortunately, led to Gray's death. An officer claimed to have noticed a knife in Gray's pocket, therefore leading to a weapons charge. A report also revealed that Gray had over 20 criminal court cases in Maryland and five of those were active at Gray's time of death. Gray mostly had drug-related charges with two different charges for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray had been in prison a couple of times.

      "(CNN)The arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality.",
      "But it's unclear how Gray, who was arrested on a weapons charge April 12, suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later.",
      "Here are the big questions surrounding this controversial case: .",
      "What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore known for drugs.",
      "He \"gave up without the use of force,\"  Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said last week.",
      "An officer apparently took his Taser out and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it, Rodriguez said.",
      "And none of the six officers involved in the arrest described using force against the 25-year-old.",
      "Gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk, said Rodriguez, who described Gray as upset.",
      "\"And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,\" according to Rodriguez.",
      "Police have said Gray was not buckled in with a seat belt during the ride to a booking center.",
      "What we don't know: It's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest, and it's also unknown what, if anything, happened inside the van.",
      "What we know: Segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after Gray has been arrested and show officers dragging Gray, who is handcuffed, to a van.",
      "He can be heard screaming.",
      "\"He was dragged a bit,\" said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, \"but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van.",
      "And we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive.\"",
      "One woman who recorded a video of the arrest said she knew Gray.",
      "\"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" the woman said.",
      "\"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling.\"",
      "Surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking, police said.",
      "That was at 8:54 a.m. At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance for Gray.",
      "Police say Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center.",
      "Rawlings-Blake and  Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis have said the arresting officers should have asked for medical attention immediately after Gray asked for it.",
      "What we don't know: It's unknown why Gray screamed, and the cell phone video doesn't capture the entire incident, start to end.",
      "And it's unclear why police didn't call for an ambulance sooner.",
      "What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers were suspended.",
      "Their names were released last week.",
      "The suspensions are standard procedure after an \"in-custody death,\" said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt.",
      "Eric Kowalczyk.",
      "It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved, he said.",
      "They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt.",
      "Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012.",
      "Three of the six responding officers were on bicycles when they initially approached Gray, according to Kowalczyk.",
      "Another officer joined the arrest after it was initiated, while one more drove the police van, the police spokesman said.",
      "What we don't know: The officers say they didn't use force against Gray, but that's not certain.",
      "In fact, details about what each of the officers specifically did have not been released.",
      "What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death.",
      "The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property.",
      "Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24.",
      "He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields.",
      "In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver.",
      "Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved.",
      "Gray was paroled on June 30, 2011.",
      "On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison, Shields said, reasoning that  whatever Gray allegedly did, it \"was something minor.\"",
      "Gray did return to prison in May 2013 for drug possession, serving a month behind bars before his release in June.",
      "What we don't know: It's not known whether Gray's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest, or his death.",
      "What we know: Protesters have taken to the streets of Baltimore daily since two days after Gray's death, rallying around his family.",
      "On the first night, they marched to a local police station chanting \"No justice!",
      "No peace!\"",
      "On another occasion they marched to City Hall.",
      "The demonstrations have been peaceful on most nights, but on Monday rioters damaged buildings and destroyed police vehicles.",
      "Looters stole goods from several stores.",
      "Some groups of people intervened, keeping additional looters out of trashed businesses.",
      "The demonstrators are pushing to get answers about Gray's death and for \"justice,\" as they define it.",
      "Similar protests were held in Ferguson, Missouri, following Michael Brown's death and in New York, after the death of Eric Garner.",
      "Other small protests have sprung up in other cities in the past week.",
      "\"Mr. Gray's family deserves justice,\" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week.",
      "\"And our community deserves an opportunity to heal, to get better, and to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again.",
      "The mayor said that any confirmed information will be promptly relayed to the public.",
      "\"I want people to understand that I have no interest in hiding information, holding back information,\" Rawlings-Blake said.",
      "Some protesters have called for the officers to be arrested and charged.",
      "One organizer called for Police Commissioner Anthony Batts to resign.",
      "What we don't know: There's no guarantee protesters will get the kind of definitive answers they want about how and why Gray died.",
      "What we know: Baltimore police are looking into Gray's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by Friday.",
      "The probe, like the suspensions of the six police officers, is standard whenever someone dies while in custody.",
      "The police's findings will go to the state's attorney's office, where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed.",
      "Batts said recently that a medical examiner had some initial findings, but needed to get back the results of toxicology reports, which could take weeks.",
      "Rawlings-Blake asked for an outside investigation, given the city's dark history of police misconduct.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department, which announced a collaborative reform initiative with Baltimore police in October in light of its past problems, is looking into the Gray case, a spokesman said last week.",
      "The point of that federal investigation will be to gauge whether a prosecutable civil rights violation may have occurred.",
      "What we don't know: What information that investigators, both local and federal, will turn up and when.",
      "It is also unclear if the medical examiner called in spinal experts to view the evidence, a possibility Batts raised at a news conference.",
      "What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket.",
      "The Gray family attorney called the allegation a \"sideshow.\"",
      "Gray was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" attorney William Murphy told CNN.",
      "Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said.",
      "The court documents also say that Gray \"fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\"",
      "\"The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.",
      "The defendant was arrested without force or incident,\" the documents say.",
      "\"The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring-assisted, one-hand-operated knife.\"",
      "Maryland law makes it illegal to \"wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind\" -- including switchblades -- \"concealed on or about the person.\"",
      "What we don't know: It's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime, said Rawlings-Blake.",
      "\"It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone.",
      "So, we still have questions,\" she said.",

Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat stated, \u201cGangs of criminals were putting people on boats, sometimes even at gunpoint.\u201d The search for the estimated 950 migrants on board the Libyan ship continues. Authorities say migrants moved to one side as rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night. The large, multilevel boat capsized about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya as a result of their movement, sending many passengers into the sea. According to one Bangladeshi survivor, the boat sank with numerous people trapped inside. Despite the fact that the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed human traffickers, accusing them of endangering people's lives by transporting them on rickety ships in dangerous waters. Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean belong to Sub-Saharan Africa, and they often travel for weeks or even months to reach the ships. The dangerous journey across the sea cost between 6,000 and 8,000 euros per person.

      "(CNN)After a weekend shipwreck off the coast of Italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants, the International Organization for Migrants said Monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters.",
      "Authorities still don't know the fate of many of the passengers, including children, who were on the large ship bound from Libya to Europe that capsized Saturday night in the frigid waters of the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "That sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages.",
      "\"Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,\" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said.",
      "\"They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else.\"",
      "A rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from Libya, and the number of potential victims is not clear.",
      "A Bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board.",
      "Previous estimates put the number around 700.",
      "Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, said around 50 people had been saved.",
      "But the Italian Coast Guard said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered.",
      "Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico.",
      "On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis.",
      "\"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" Federica Mogherini told CNN's \"The World Right Now with Hala Gorani.\"",
      "The EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees.",
      "\"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said.",
      "\"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\"",
      "Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days, along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route.",
      "Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said last week.",
      "Since the beginning of 2015, more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea -- 23,500 have landed in Italy and more than 12,000 in Greece, according to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights.",
      "While those numbers sound high, they were even higher the previous year.",
      "In 2014, approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the Mediterranean, with most having to be rescued by the Italian Navy, Coast Guard or merchant ships, the UNCHR said.",
      "It is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea.",
      "On Monday, yet another boat sank off the Greek island of Rhodes, killing at least three people, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said.",
      "Of the 83 people reported on board, at least 57 survived.",
      "Those confirmed dead were a man, a woman and a child.",
      "The capsizing of the ship that departed from Libya marked the worst such disaster so far.",
      "As rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night, authorities say, migrants moved to one side, hoping to be saved.",
      "Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya, sending many passengers plunging into the sea.",
      "According to one Bangladeshi survivor, large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank.",
      "Smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel, the survivor told Italian authorities.",
      "\"Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,\" Muscat said.",
      "While the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters.",
      "It's \"genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,\" Muscat told CNN.",
      "\"A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,\" said Loris De Filippi, the president of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders.",
      "He compared the high number of deaths to \"figures from a war zone.\"",
      "De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores.",
      "\"Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,\" he said.",
      "\"This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped.\"",
      "Save the Children similarly called on European officials to do more.",
      "\"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" the group's CEO Justin Forsyth said in a statement.",
      "\"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss.",
      "Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\"",
      "Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean come from sub-Saharan Africa, often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships.",
      "They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages.",
      "\"There is a well-oiled machine with the human traffickers, first by land and then by sea, and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to Europe at all costs,\" said Rome-based journalist Barbie Nadeau.",
      "The situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend isn't unusual, based on accounts of previous voyages.",
      "On old fishing boats, \"people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship,\" Nadeau said.",
      "\"Those are the cheaper tickets.",
      "People that want to be out on the upper deck, which is the prime space, pay a little more for that service.\"",
      "Traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ($6,450 to $8,600) per person for the dangerous voyage, she said.",
      "Italy's proximity to the North African coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent's migration crisis.",
      "\"We're swamped,\" Sandro Gozi, the Italian minister for European affairs, told French daily Le Monde.",
      "\"There's not even enough space in Sicily's cemeteries to bury the dead.\"",
      "An Italian search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum, was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year.",
      "But it ended in October because of budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean.",
      "The European Union's border control agency, Frontex, started its own mission in November, known as Triton, with a budget of less than a third of that of Mare Nostrum.",
      "Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships.",
      "As anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent, European nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep.",
      "\"We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen,\" Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting \"a total absence\" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, said Sunday it was consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy to be adopted in mid-May.",
      "\"These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act,\" it said.",
      "But international groups say European governments are failing to do enough.",
      "Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, De Filippi said, because \"as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer.\"",

      "(CNN)On April 20, 2010, a final cement seal of an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico failed, causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history and taking the lives of 11 rig workers.",
      "For 87 straight days, oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead, 1 mile below the surface of the ocean.",
      "The federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf, but BP argued in court that it was much lower.",
      "A judge ruled BP was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels.",
      "Imagining Daddy: A rig worker's daughter and her dreams .",
      "There were dire predictions of what would follow.",
      "Environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale.",
      "Scientists continue to study environmental impacts, but five years after the spill, the long-term negative effects remain unclear and are, in many cases, highly disputed.",
      "BP, the company that caused the spill, is eager to point out it appears the Gulf of Mexico is healing itself.",
      "BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, said there is no doubt birds, fish, turtles, sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill.",
      "Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.",
      "\"There's no question about that,\" Morrell said.",
      "\"But they have also, according to the data, bounced back and are recovering strongly.\"",
      "\"And there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\"",
      "While BP's assessment has not been disproven, the government suggests it's too soon to make long-term conclusions about the rebounding health of the Gulf.",
      "Shortly after BP released its own five-year report that concluded the Gulf has largely recovered, the trustees of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment called BP's report \"inappropriate as well as premature.\"",
      "The trustees, a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the Macondo spill, released a statement, saying, \"We know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations.\"",
      "One government official familiar with the trustee's assessment accused BP of having \"cherry-picked\" positive results while ignoring others, something BP denies.",
      "Most long-term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed.",
      "Studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill, but others show some of those species are bouncing back.",
      "Fish landings in the Gulf, the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry, have returned.",
      "Oysters are also recovering in many areas.",
      "And according to the Food and Drug Administration, tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region's food supply.",
      "The spill's effects on other species are less clear.",
      "Dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the Gulf Coast, and even more so in Louisiana where the oil hit the hardest.",
      "But the dolphin \"mortality event,\" as the government calls it, began months before the spill.",
      "Studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like Barataria Bay, Louisiana, could be caused by oil exposure, but direct links to the 2010 Macondo spill have not been proven.",
      "Seaside sparrows in the Gulf are also showing signs of strain, and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance.",
      "While aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters, government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long-term effects on sea turtle populations.",
      "But perhaps the greatest unknown is what, if anything, millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the Gulf itself.",
      "Oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the Macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean.",
      "Mandy Joye, an oceanographer with the University of Georgia, has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled.",
      "Her research and other studies show BP's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor.",
      "According to Joye's study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others.",
      "Joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean.",
      "\"That stuff's not going to stay put.",
      "It's going to move around, \" Joye said.",
      "She said that right now, there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact.",
      "\"There's so much that we don't know,\" Joye said.",
      "BP doesn't accept the results of Joye's work.",
      "The company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places: within a 2 kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach.",
      "And according to BP's Morrell, the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful.",
      "\"So much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life,\" Morrell said.",
      "Ocean conservationist Philippe Cousteau witnessed much of the spill's aftermath in 2010, but when he returned to the Gulf to dive near an oil rig last month, he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks, hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw.",
      "During the same trip, however, Cousteau spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf.",
      "It is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil.",
      "Cousteau commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill, but he said he believes it's far too early to say the Gulf is back and the oil is gone.",
      "\"It is still in many cases in the sand, along the shoreline, in the marshes,\" Cousteau said, \"and existing on a microscopic scale that we may not be able to see with the naked eye.\"",

It is not a chance for the left and right to regurgitate already formed opinions on what caused the uproar but a chance to look in deeper and challenge their status quo. The left argues that the riots are the result of alienation and violence against the community. While the conservatives stick to their own narratives about lack of personal responsibility and the failures of Great Society and Democratic programs. Eric Liu confirms that structural racism and personal irresponsibility were involved. Both are a result of a lack of leaders willing to address the issues. Liu said aspects of the problem that don't fit the preferred explanation cannot be ignored if problems are to be solved.",
